		 			 Here you will find a free api that allows you to retreive programming focused interview questions and solutions. I have set up four different api endpoints that currently only host a total of 10 questions each. The motivation for creating this API was the inability to find my own when looking for a free one to use. More questions will be added in the future.

		 				The types of endpoints include:

		 			<ul>
		 				<li>/programming-question</li>
		 				<li>/programming-questions</li>
		 				<li>/star-question</li>
